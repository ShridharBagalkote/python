His dominance was complete, showcasing his incredible power hitting and timing.\\n\\n* **His numerous double centuries in ODIs:**  Besides the 264, he has scored two other double centuries in ODIs, highlighting his remarkable consistency at the highest level in this format.\\n\\n* **His consistent performance in IPL:** While not technically for the national team, his consistently high scores and match-winning performances for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL are legendary and showcase his batting prowess.  Specific matches are hard to pinpoint as \"great\" without further specifying criteria (highest score, most impactful, etc.).\\n\\n* **Match-winning knocks in crucial World Cup matches:**  While specific scores might not always be incredibly high,  Rohit has played many crucial innings in World Cup matches that have propelled India to victory. These are difficult to single out without knowing your specific criteria for \"greatness\".\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s important to note that defining a \"great knock\" can be subjective, depending on the context of the match, the pressure situation, and the overall impact on the game.
